(a) The following is the class hierarchy of Java’s Collection framework. A dotted-lined box and solid-lined box indicate an interface and a concrete/abstract class,
    respectively. An arrow from one box to another indicates that the former box is inherited/implemented by the latter box.

Collection
├── List
│   ├── AbstractList
│   │   ├── AbstractSequentialList
│   │   │   ├── LinkedList
│   │   ├── ArrayList
├── Queue
│   ├── AbstractQueue
│   │   ├── PriorityQueue
│   ├── Deque
│   │   ├── AbstractDeque
├── Set
│   ├── AbstractSet
│   │   ├── HashSet

│   │   ├── TreeSet
├── AbstractCollection



    
(I) You want to write a code that uses a HashSet data structure. What are the types of reference variables you can use?


Answer:


In Java, a HashSet can be referenced using multiple types based on the level of abstraction. According to the given collection hierarchy, the possible reference types are:

1. HashSet<T> (Concrete class)
    - Allows access to all HashSet-specific methods.
    - Least flexible.

     
    HashSet<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
    

2. AbstractSet<T> (Abstract class)
    - Provides some abstraction while retaining Set properties.
 

    AbstractSet<String> abstractSet = new HashSet<>();
 

3. Set<T> (Interface) (Best choice)
    - Allows flexibility to switch to TreeSet, LinkedHashSet, etc.

 
    Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
 

4. Collection<T> (Super interface)
    - More generic but loses Set-specific behavior.

 
    Collection<String> collection = new HashSet<>();
 

5. AbstractCollection<T> (Abstract class)
    - Even more abstract, rarely used directly.

 
    AbstractCollection<String> abstractCollection = new HashSet<>();
