 (b) Given the following code snippet, explain what is going on inside btn.setOnAction (...) ; expression:

public void start(Stage primaryStage) {

    primaryStage.setTitle("Hello World!");

    Button btn = new Button();

    btn.setText("Say 'Hello World'");

    btn.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
        @Override
        public void handle(ActionEvent event) {

            System.out.println("Hello World!");

        }

    });

    // other code...

}


Answer: The code snippet is creating a button object and setting its text to "Say 'Hello World'". It then sets an action event handler on the button object.
        The action event handler is an anonymous inner class that implements the EventHandler interface. The handle method of the EventHandler interface is overridden
       to print "Hello World!" to the console when the button is clicked. This allows the button to perform an action when it is clicked.
