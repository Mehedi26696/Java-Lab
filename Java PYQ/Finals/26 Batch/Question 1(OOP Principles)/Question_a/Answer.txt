(a) What do you understand about platform independence of a programming language? How does Java achieve this?


Answe:

Platform independence means that a program can run on any hardware or operating system without modification. 
Java achieves platform independence through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When Java code is compiled, 
it is converted into bytecode, which is a platform-independent code. The JVM on each platform interprets this bytecode and executes it, 
allowing the same Java program to run on any device that has a compatible JVM.
