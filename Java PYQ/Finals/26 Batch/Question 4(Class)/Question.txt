 
(a) (I) Why does Java not allow two classes to be inherited by the same class? Explain the problem (with appropriate example code)
     that may ensue if one class inherits two classes.

    (II) Explain in the light of your example given in your answer to (I) as to how using the interface avoids the problem.


(b) Explain the benefits of abstract classes to represent mixed-type components of an object. (For example, a document file like .docx or .odt file is 
    an object with mixed- type components such as texts, images, lists, etc.)
