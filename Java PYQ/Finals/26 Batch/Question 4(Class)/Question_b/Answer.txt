(b) Explain the benefits of abstract classes to represent mixed-type components of an object. (For example, a document file like .docx or .odt file is 
    an object with mixed- type components such as texts, images, lists, etc.)

Answer:

Abstract classes provide a way to define a common interface for a group of related classes while allowing for some implementation details to be shared. 
This is particularly useful for representing mixed-type components of an object, such as a document file with texts, images, lists, etc. The benefits include:

1. Code Reusability: Abstract classes allow you to define methods that can be shared by multiple subclasses, reducing code duplication.
2. Polymorphism: They enable polymorphic behavior, allowing you to treat different types of components uniformly through a common interface.
3. Encapsulation: Abstract classes can encapsulate common state and behavior, making the code easier to manage and understand.
4. Extensibility: New types of components can be added with minimal changes to the existing codebase by simply extending the abstract class.
5. Design Flexibility: They provide a flexible design that can evolve over time, accommodating new requirements and changes in the system.

Overall, abstract classes help in creating a robust and maintainable code structure for complex objects with mixed-type components.
