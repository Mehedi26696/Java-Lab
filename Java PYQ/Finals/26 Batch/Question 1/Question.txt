(b) Briefly explain the following concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): abstraction. encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

(c) The following is a typical implementation of stack data structure written in procedural language (C in this case):


void push (int st[], int tos, int num) {
     st[tos] = num;
}

int pop(int st[], int tos){

    return st[tos];

}

main() {

   int stack[5];
   int tos=0;
   push (stack, tos, 45);
   tos++;
   push(stack, tos, 4);
   tos++;
   tos--;
   int item = pop (stack, tos); 
   printf("%d", item);
   tos--;
   int item = pop (stack, tos);
   printf("%d", item);

}


Rewrite the above code in Java so that the OOP principles are enforced as much as
possible.
