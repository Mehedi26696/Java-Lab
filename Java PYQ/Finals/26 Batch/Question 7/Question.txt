 (a) Suppose Language is a class that is inherited by three classes namely Bangla, English, and Arabic. Bangla class is further inherited by two classes: Cholti and Shadhu.
     For the sake of simplicity, assume that each of these classes has only a single constructor which takes a string as parameter and sets it to a local variable.


     
     Write a generic class named AnyLang that works on only types of objects of Language class or any of its subclasses. AnyLang has only a single data structure 
     which is an array of the object. In its constructor, it takes an array of objects as a parameter and assigns it to the local array reference variable. 
     In another class called Demo, in the main function, create two objects of AnyLang class with Language and Bangla classes, respectively.


 (b) Given the following code snippet, explain what is going on inside btn.setOnAction (...) ; expression:


    public void start (Stage primaryStage) {

           primaryStage.setTitle("Hello World!");

           Button btn = new Button();

           btn.setText("Say 'Hello World'");

           btn.setOnAction (new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() { 
            @Override
            public void handle (ActionEvent event) {

                System.out.println("Hello World!");

         }

    });


//other code...

}

  (c) Define the following two terms with an example of each: (i) anonymous class, and (ii) functional interface.
