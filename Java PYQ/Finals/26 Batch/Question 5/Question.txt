(a) What are the two ways in Java a thread can be created? Why does Java offer these two ways instead of one only?


(b) Put appropriate exception handling code in the following code snippet. You must use the best practice of exception handling.


public static void main(String args[]){

    int i=0;
    FileInputStream fin= new FileInputStream (filename); //may throw IOException

    do {

    i = fin.read(); //may throw IOException

    if(i!= -1) System.out.print((char) i);

    } while (i!= -1);

    fin.close(); //may throw IOException

}
