(a) Write down the differences between the four access modes of Java: default case.
    private, protected, and public. (You do not need to give examples, just answer in text.)

(b) Mention three cases where the final keyword is used and why.

(c) When is a static block of code executed? Write down the output of the following code segment:


class A {
     static int a;
     static int b;
     static {
       System.out.println("a: " + a + ", b: " + b);
     }
     {

        b++;
        System.out.println("b in block: " + b);
     }

     public A(){
        
        System.out.println("constructor");
     }
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Some text.");
        A ob = new A();
        A ob2 = new A();

    }

}
