(a) Write down the differences between the four access modes of Java: default case.
    private, protected, and public. (You do not need to give examples, just answer in text.)

Answer:

1. Default: When no access modifier is specified, it is considered default. The scope is limited to the package. It is not accessible from outside the package.

2. Private: The scope of private access modifier is limited to the class only. It is not accessible from outside the class.

3. Protected: The scope of protected access modifier is within the package and also accessible in subclasses outside the package.

4. Public: The public access modifier has the widest scope. It is accessible from any other class in any package.
