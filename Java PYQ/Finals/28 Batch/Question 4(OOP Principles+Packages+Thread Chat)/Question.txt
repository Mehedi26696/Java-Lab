(a) "Suppose, you are implementing a database for storing the information of some students. You will be given an array of students. Each student has a unique name 
     and three additional features - age, nationality, and address. After storing the information, you will be asked with a query given by a string X to fetch the 
     data of the student named X. If no such entry exists, you need to create a custom exception denoting the issue."
     Write a Java program for the above scenario. Not that you can only use basic Arrays and can't use any sophisticated collection framework (e.g., HashMap, ArrayList, Set, etc..).

(b) Consider the two packages p1 and p2 with the corresponding source files. Identify any problematic issues that would hinder the successful compilation and running.
    State the rationale behind your answer.

code:

package p1;

import p2.B;
import p2.D;

class C extends B{

   public void temp() {
          x = 11;
          y = 12;
          a = 13; 
     }
}


public class A{

      public static void main (String[] args) {

              B b = new B();
              b.a = 10;
              b.x = 20;
              b.y = 30;
              b.z = 70;
      }
}

Under Package p1, A.java


code:

package p2;

class D {

}

public class B {
     int x;
     public int y;
     private int z;
     protected int a;
}

Under Package p2, B.java

(c) Write a Java program to create a simple chat application where two persons can simultaneously
    send and receive messages.
