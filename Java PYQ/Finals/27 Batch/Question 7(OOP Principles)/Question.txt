(a) Generate the output of the following Java program and state the reason for your result:


    public class A{
         A() {
            System.out.println("Constructor of A");
         }

        void print() {
            System.out.println("Inside print method of A");
        }
    }

public class B extends A{

    B() {
        System.out.println("Constructor of B");
    }
    void print() {
        System.out.println("Inside print method of B");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        A a = new B();

       a.print();
    }
}

(b) Create a Shape interface with two methods, draw and area(). Implement two classes (Rectangle and Circle) those implement the Shape class. 
    The first method exhibits a print statement to show a certain figure is drawn, and the other method calculates the area. Each class (Rectangle and Circle) 
    should take enough input to calculate the area for a certain shape. Your task is to design the classes based on the given scenario.

(c) What is the difference between method overriding and method overloading? Explain with examples.
