 
(a) What is the difference between checked exceptions (e.g., IOException) and unchecked exceptions (e.g., ArithmeticException) in Java, and how are they handled differently in the code?


(b) Suppose you are building a weather application that retrieves weather data from different APIs. The APIs can return different exceptions, such as 
    NetworkException , DataFormatException and UnauthorizedException where

    DataFormatException and UnauthorizedException, inherit NetworkException.
    
    In addition to these exceptions, other exceptions may be generated as well. Write a try-catch block to handle each of these exceptions separately and 
    provide appropriate error messages. Briefly explain your code.



 
(c) Explain the difference between the "throw" and "throws" keywords in Java exception handling with example codes.
