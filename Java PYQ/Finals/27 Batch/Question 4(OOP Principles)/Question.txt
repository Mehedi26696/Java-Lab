 
(a)Consider the following facts:

          Humans breath, eat, move(walk), talk 
          Birds breath, eat, move(fly), chirp 
          Fishes breath, eat, move(swim)
          Dogs breath, eat, move(run), bark
   Design the class/interface hierarchy and then write Java code that reflects the OOP principles.

   Hint: You may create separate classes/interfaces for humans, birds, fishes, dogs, and possibly some more as per your needs. The actions of an animal may be represented by a 
   single-statement method, for example, to implement human's breathing action, you may write the statement:

    System.out.println("Breathing...");
    or
    System.out.println("Human is breathing...") ;

In your code, you should practice OOP principles as much as possible.


(b) Explain the concept of the "super" keyword in Java. How is it used in method overriding?
