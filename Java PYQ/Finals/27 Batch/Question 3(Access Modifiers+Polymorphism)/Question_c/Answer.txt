(c) Consider the following statement -
      public static void main(String args[])

    Describe why the main method should always be public and static.

Answer:
The main method should always be public and static for the following reasons:

1. public: The main method must be public so that it is accessible to the Java runtime system. If it is not public, 
               the Java runtime system will not be able to access it, and the program will not run.

2. static: The main method must be static because it needs to be called by the Java runtime system without creating 
            an instance of the class. Since the main method is the entry point of the program, it must be called without any object.
             Making it static allows the Java runtime to call it directly using the class name.
