 
(a) Explain the different types of polymorphism that are available in Java with an example.

(b) Suppose a subclass inherits a method implementation from a superclass, and implements a Java interface (that's the interface keyword) that 
    contains a method with the same name and prototype.

        I. Will Java compile the result? What if the method declaration in the interface has a different return type?
        II.What if the method declaration in the interface has the same return type, but a signature with a different parameter type?


(c) Consider the following statement -
      public static void main(String args[])

    Describe why the main method should always be public and static.

(d) Describe the scope of public, private, protected, and default access modifiers.
