(b) Suppose a subclass inherits a method implementation from a superclass, and implements a Java interface (that's the interface keyword) that 
    contains a method with the same name and prototype.

        I. Will Java compile the result? What if the method declaration in the interface has a different return type?
        II.What if the method declaration in the interface has the same return type, but a signature with a different parameter type?

Answer:
I.  Java will compile the result.
    If the method declaration in the interface has a different return type, then Java will not compile the result.

II. Java will not compile the result.
