     I.Explain the purpose of packages in java and how they can be used to organize and manage large-scale Java projects.

     II.Provide an example of a package hierarchy that you might use for a project involving user authentication, product management, order processing, and customer support. 
You need to write the package names and their member classes. Suppose the available classes are:


         ProductManager.java,
         User.java,
         Inventory.java,
         Order.java,
         PaymentProcessor.java,
         AuthenticationManager.java,
         Product.java,
         Customer.java,
         OrderManager.java and
         SupportTicket.java


 Answer:
 I. Organization: By grouping related classes and interfaces together, packages help in organizing the code, making it easier to manage and maintain.
    Namespace Management: Packages create a namespace for the classes and interfaces, which helps in avoiding naming conflicts. This means you can have classes with the same name in
    different packages without any issues.Access Control: Packages also provide a way to control access to classes and interfaces. You can specify which classes are accessible from
    outside the package and which are not.

 II. Example of a package hierarchy for a project involving user authentication, product management, order processing, and customer support:
 
src/
└── com/
    └── ecommerce/
        ├── authentication/
        │   ├── AuthenticationManager.java
        │   └── User.java
        ├── product/
        │   ├── ProductManager.java
        │   ├── Product.java
        │   └── Inventory.java
        ├── order/
        │   ├── Order.java
        │   ├── OrderManager.java
        │   └── PaymentProcessor.java
        └── support/
            ├── SupportTicket.java
            └── Customer.java
