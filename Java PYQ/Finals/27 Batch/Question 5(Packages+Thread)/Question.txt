  I.Explain the purpose of packages in java and how they can be used to organize and manage large-scale Java projects.

  II.Provide an example of a package hierarchy that you might use for a project involving user authentication, product management, order processing, and customer support. 
     You need to write the package names and their member classes. Suppose the available classes are:


        ProductManager.java,
        User.java,
        Inventory.java,
        Order.java,
        PaymentProcessor.java,
        AuthenticationManager.java,
        Product.java,
        Customer.java,
        OrderManager.java and
        SupportTicket.java

   I.What are the main benefits of using multithreading in Java?

   II.Explain how the following code snippet creates a new thread and starts it:

    Thread thread = new Thread (() -> {
        // some code to be executed in a separate thread
      });
      
    thread.start();
